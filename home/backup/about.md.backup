# Biography

I am a Research Associate in the Biomedical Image Analysis Group, Imperial College London working with Dr. [Ben Glocker](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/b.glocker) and Dr. [Bernhard Kainz](http://wp.doc.ic.ac.uk/bkainz/). 

Previously I was a postdoc at [Disney Research Zurich](https://www.disneyresearch.com/), working on Computer Vision and Machine Learning problems related to real-time facial capture. I earned my Ph.D. at the University of Edinburgh in the [Institute of Perception, Action and Behaviour](http://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/ipab) under the supervision of Prof. [Bob Fisher](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/) for my work on large scale multi-view depth image and 3D point set registration. 

My research interests span topics in Computer Vision, Machine Learning and Medical Image Analysis. You can occasionally find me up a mountain climbing or cycling.
